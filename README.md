# Angular Webpack Seed Project
This seed project is meant to allow for anyone to get an angular application off the ground within minutes. It uses webpack to do all of the bundling and babel for trans-compiling any es6 down to es5. It will use karma with jasmine for the tests and will use browser-sync to allow for rapid development.
